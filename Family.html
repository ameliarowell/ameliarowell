		My parents are Kathy and Dave Rowell, my dad is a self-employed carpenter and my 
		mom is a lunch lady at our local high school. My dad enjoys skiing and sports, and
		is one of nicest, laid back, easy going guys around he is the best! My mom is 
		always staying busy whether it is working out in her big vegetable garden or any 
		other house work she can find. She is very artistic and loves to do creative 
		things, but she is also a really good cook! I can never get enough of her food 
		and always miss it while i'm away at school. My parents are the best, they do
		so much for my sister and I, I love them lots!

		My sister, Olivia,  also goes to school here and is a junior with her major being 
		social work. With her only being 2 years older then me we have always been super 
		close and we hardly ever fight, I'm so glad we have such a great relationship 
		together.
